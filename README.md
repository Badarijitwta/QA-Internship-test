MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS<br/><br/>


Question [1] <br/>
What is the main goal of software testing? <br/>
a. To find as many defects as possible <br/>
b. To verify that the software meets its requirements and is fit for purpose <br/>
c. To make sure that the software is perfect and free of defects <br/>
d. To reduce the development time of the software <br/>

Answer : <br/>
b. To verify that the software meets its requirements and is fit for purpose. <br/><br/>

Question [2] <br/>
What is the difference between validation and verification?<br/>
a. Validation checks if the software meets its requirements, while verification checks if the software is functioning as intended.<br/>
b. Verification checks if the software meets its requirements, while validation checks if the software is functioning as intended.<br/>
c. Validation and verification are the same thing.<br/>
d. None of the above.<br/>

Answer : <br/>
b. Verification checks if the software meets its requirements, while validation checks if the software is functioning as intended.<br/><br/>

What is the purpose of a test plan?<br/>
a. To define the testing strategy and approach for a project<br/>
b. To document the test results<br/>
c. To execute the test cases<br/>
d. To identify defects in the software<br/>

Answer : <br/>
a. To define the testing strategy and approach for a project.<br/><br/>

THEORY BASED QUESTIONS<br/><br/>
Question [2]<br/>
Your team is developing a mobile application that needs to be tested on multiple devices and operating systems.<br/>
What type of testing would you perform to ensure that the application functions correctly on all devices and operating systems?<br/>

Answer:<br/>
<b>Compatibility testing</b><br/>
Basically, it is a type of testing that verifies whether the software can function correctly across
multiple hardware, software, and network configurations.<br/>
In the case of a mobile application, compatibility testing would involve testing the application on various devices with different 
screen sizes, resolutions, processors, and memory capacities, as well as different operating systems (e.g., Android, iOS) 
and versions of those operating systems. The goal of this testing is to identify any issues or bugs that may arise from differences 
in hardware or software configurations.<br/><br/>

Question [3]<br/>
Your team is developing a web application that allows users to upload and view images.<br/>
What type of testing would you perform to ensure that the images are uploaded and displayed correctly?<br/>

Answer:<br/>
<b>Visual testing</b> <br/>
Visual testing is a type of testing that verifies whether the visual aspects of a software application are functioning correctly,
such as layout, formatting, and the appearance of images and other graphical elements.
In the case of a web application that allows users to upload and view images, visual testing would involve verifying that the 
images are displayed correctly on the web page and that they appear as intended. This would include testing that the images are 
uploaded in the correct format, that they are displayed at the correct size and resolution, and that any text or other graphical 
elements on the page are properly positioned and formatted around the images. <br/><br/>

Question [5]<br/>
Your team is developing an e-commerce website that needs to handle online payments. What type of testing would you perform <br/>
to ensure that the payment process is secure and reliable?<br/>

Answer : <br/>
To ensure that the payment process in an e-commerce website is secure and reliable, <b>security testing and reliability testing</b> has to be performed.<br/>
With the goal of ensuring that the system is secure from malicious attacks or unauthorized access. For an e-commerce website, 
<b>Security testing</b> would involve testing the payment process to ensure that sensitive customer data (such as credit card numbers) is transmitted and stored securely, and that the website is protected against common attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.<br/> <br/>
<b>Reliability testing</b> would involve testing the payment process under a variety of conditions (such as heavy traffic or intermittent connectivity) 
to ensure that the system can handle different types of user behavior and continue to function reliably.<br/> <br/> 

Question [7]<br/>
Your team is developing a social media application that needs to handle a large number of concurrent users.<br/> 
What type of testing would you perform to ensure that the application can handle the expected load?<br>

Answer: <br/>
Load testing involves simulating real-world user traffic and measuring the application's performance under heavy load.
This can help identify bottlenecks, performance issues, and other problems that may arise when many users are using the application simultaneously.<br/>
Some key steps of load testing needs to be considered while running against social media applications : <br/>
[1]. Determination of expected user load <br/> 
[2]. Setting up the testing tools <br/> 
[3]. Creation of load testing scenarios<br/> 
[4]. Run the load test<br/> 
[5]. Analyze the results<br/> <br/>
